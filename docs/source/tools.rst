YosysHQ Tool Documentation
==========================

Yosys
-----

Yosys is a framework for RTL synthesis and more. It currently has extensive 
Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various 
application domains. Yosys is the core component of most our implementation and 
verification flows.

SBY
---

SBY is a front-end for Yosys-based formal verification flows for safety 
properties, liveness properties, and reachability.  Different engines offer a
variety of solving methods in order to find the fastest solution.

MCY
---

MCY uses Yosys to provide mutation coverage of testbenches.  By using built-in 
equivalence checking, the common problem with equivalent mutations can be 
avoided, and 100% coverage can be targeted.

EQY
---

EQY is an upcoming tool to provide Yosys-based equivalence checking for formal 
verification.
